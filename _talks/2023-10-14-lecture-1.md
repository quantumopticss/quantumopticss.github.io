This is my first time to make lectures to share my experiences in some fields.
The lectures are about COMSOL for freshmen, which include three parts and lasted 9 hours in total， which can provide a guidance for someone who are interested in physics simulation.

Contents
======
* A brief on science computation and the importance of physics simulation：
    * Why we have to do simulations
    * What can COMSOL do for us
    * Knowledge about COMSOL and its products
* Basic CAD skills
* Basic knowledges about:
    * Work flows of simulation
    * How to choose suitable products
    * Ways to simplify you system to simulate
    * Choose and Define suitable material for your simulations
    * The importance of boundary conditions
    * Ways to design better meshes for you system
    * Some skills to show your result
* Some example about :
    * AC/DC
    * CFD
    * Heat transfer 
    * Structure Mechanics
