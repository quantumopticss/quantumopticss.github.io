In this Blog, we will discuss a kind of mathematical phase transition -- Percolation. 

Let's image a r*r suqare matrix. Everypoint has a possibility p to become a stone. And stones may links each other and become a boundary. So naturally we can use different colour to fill in these areas which are devided by those boundaries. And we can get the results below:

<img src='/images/ys_colour_0.2.jpg' alt="Colour Percolation with p = 0.2"> <img src='/images/ys_colour_0.4.jpg' alt="Colour Percolation with p = 0.4">    <img src='/images/ys_colour_0.6.jpg' alt="Colour Percolation with p = 0.6">

We notice that: when p is small, the colour area is orderly, however, when p is large , we will get chaos results.

We can use another method to describe Percolation: image we stand on the left side of the square and we want to send water through those boundaries. The possibilities of our success in sending water to the otherside P is  a function of p. P = f(p)

Percolation shows that P will go through a mathematical phase transition: P will be 1 if p <= 0.618 and will be zero when p is on the right side.
