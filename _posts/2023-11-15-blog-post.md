In this Blog, we use Montecarlo methods to simulate 2D Ising Model and XY Model , which suggest that there will exist a sort of second order phase transition in these systems. In our simulation, we only consider interaction between neighbourhood spins.  

In 2D Ising Model, spins, which only have two states, up and down are placed in 2D plane. If two neighbour spin have the same state, they will contribute -J to the system's Hamiltonian, where J>0 models the spin-spin intercation. 

2D XY model is only a little different from 2D ising model, in which spins have a angle ranging from [0,2\pi], and energy of two spins will reset to be E = -Jcos(\theta_2 - \theta_1).

If we change the rules of the game, we will get IFS system, one example is Barnsley Fern.

This paper may stimulate people's interests about fractal and provide some basic knowledge about it. 
If you wonder how can we design our fractals by playing Chaos Games, you can find some information in my paper.
