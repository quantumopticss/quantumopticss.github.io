In this Blog, we use Montecarlo methods to simulate Ising Model and KT Transition, which suggest that there will exist a sort of second order phase transition in these symmetric system. 

For example, we can use Chaos Games to create figures like Sierpinski triangles and Sierpinski blankets

If we change the rules of the game, we will get IFS system, one example is Barnsley Fern.

This paper may stimulate people's interests about fractal and provide some basic knowledge about it. 
If you wonder how can we design our fractals by playing Chaos Games, you can find some information in my paper.
