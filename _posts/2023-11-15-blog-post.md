In this Blog, we use Montecarlo methods to simulate Ising Model and KT Transition, which suggest that there will exist a sort of second order phase transition in these symmetric system. 

Ising model is a spin-spin action model, in which we only consider neighbour interaction. We consider spins, which only have two states, up and down are placed in 2D plane. Two near spins will contribute to the system's Hamiltonian

2D XY model is only a little different from 2D ising model, in which spins have a angle ranging from [0,2\pi].

If we change the rules of the game, we will get IFS system, one example is Barnsley Fern.

This paper may stimulate people's interests about fractal and provide some basic knowledge about it. 
If you wonder how can we design our fractals by playing Chaos Games, you can find some information in my paper.
