It was the frist time I tried to write Blogs. This paper, which won the First Grade Award in the 26th Forum of Science & Art of Nanjing University, analyze "ChaosGames" in which random operators will generate fractals.In this paper, we use mathematical methods to prove that and provide a model to predict the shape of fractals. 

For example, we can use Chaos Games to create figures like Sierpinski triangles and Sierpinski blankets

If we change the rules of the game, we will get IFS system, one example is Barnsley Fern.

This paper may stimulate people's interests about fractal and provide some basic knowledge about it. 
If you wonder how can we design our fractals by playing Chaos Games, you can find some information in my paper.
