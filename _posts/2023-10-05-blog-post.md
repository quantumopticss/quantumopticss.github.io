It was the frist time I tried to write Blogs. This paper, which won the First Grade Award in the 26th Forum of Science & Art of Nanjing University, analyze "ChaosGames" in which random operators will generate fractals.In this paper, we use mathematical methods to prove that and provide a model to predict the shape of fractals.
