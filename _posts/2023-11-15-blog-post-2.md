In this Blog, we use Montecarlo methods to simulate 2D Ising Model and XY Model , which suggest that there will exist a sort of second order phase transition in these systems. In our simulation, we only consider interaction between neighbourhood spins.  

In 2D Ising Model, spins, which only have two states, up and down are placed in 2D plane. If two neighbour spin have the same state, they will contribute -J to the system's Hamiltonian, where J>0 models the spin-spin intercation. 

2D XY model is only a little different from 2D ising model, in which spins have a angle ranging from [0,2\pi], and energy of two spins will reset to be E = -Jcos(\theta_2 - \theta_1). 

By MonteCarlo Simulation, we will notice that when the system's tempurature T is higher than 1.57*J/Kb there will exist some vortexes in XY Model. When T is lower that 2.56J/kb , there will exist ferromagnetism in Ising Model.
